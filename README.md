# calculator
The last project of The Odin Project Foundations Course!

Project description: In this project I built a basic calculator using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The calculator I built can perform basic mathematical operations. I had the chance to use some HTML, CSS and JS skills I've acquired along the way, as long as continue improving my DOM manipulation skills. 

I'd also like to give a shoutout to @WEB CIFAR on Youtube, because his videos helped me out tremendously when it came to understanding the logic necessary to complete this project.
